Rect is 2D platformer puzzle made by me (Abdelhadi) for the KGJ 2020
in 5 days .

The story 
-
It is about Rect which is a rectangle trying to find the biggest rectangle ever . started the adventure with Ract the smaller rectangle inside him .

GamepLay 
-
The game play is mainly about moving object, pressing buttons, and using Ract's help .. but it's a puzzle game so I've limited the help by taking away one of the abilities **moving right**, **moving left** or **jumping** 

controls 
-
- A, D : moving .
- S : press and hold while in top of boxes to move them with you.
- Space : jumping, double jumping.
- E : reset the level.
- Sheft : turn on/off child mode.
- after turning on child mode u have to choose an ability to lose : 
	- A : you won't be able to go left again.
	- D : you won't be able to go right again.
	- Space : you won't be able to jump again.
	- left ctrl : reset controls.   
 

The art
-
All the art is done by me with a good looking minimalistic design .

The Theme
-
Rect have ract inside him just like the doll and the levels draw a rectangular shape .
