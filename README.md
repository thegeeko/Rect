Rect is 2D platformer puzzle made by me (Abdelhadi) for the KGJ 2020
in 5 days .

The story 
-
It is about Rect which is a rectangle trying to find the biggest rectangle ever . started the adventure with Ract the smaller rectangle inside him .

GamepLay 
-
The game play is mainly about moving object, pressing buttons, and using Ract's help .. but it's a puzzle game so I've limited the help by taking away one of the abilities **moving right**, **moving left** or **jumping** 

The art
-
All the art is done by me with a good looking minimalistic design .

The Theme
-
Rect have ract inside him just like the doll and the levels draw a rectangular shape .
  
  # What next
  Level 6 and the game are not completed I'll be adding more and more levels and getting the game to the next level.
